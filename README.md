# Awesome Fuzzing [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> [Fuzzing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing) or fuzz testing is an automated software testing technique that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to a computer program. The program is then monitored for exceptions such as crashes, failing built-in code assertions, or potential memory leaks. Typically, fuzzers are used to test programs that take structured inputs. 

A curated list of references to awesome Fuzzing for security testing. Additionally there is a collection of freely available academic papers, tools and so on.

top major security conferences and others from Jan 2008 to Jul 2019.
It includes (i) Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS), (ii) IEEE Symposium on
Security and Privacy (S&P), (iii) USENIX Security Symposium (USEC), and (iv) ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS).
